## Building Web Applications with Ajax

Ajax is the backbone of interactive high-performance web apps.



### Prerequisite
We are going to use 2 API for the data contents

    -   OpenWwatherMap (OpenWeatherMap.org) - To Obtain the weather details of passed location.
    -   EventBrite (EventBriter.com) - Nearby Event details.

To use both of these API's, we must login and create API Keys on both sites so it would allow us to fetch data from these API's via AJAX call.
